# Series Parquet end-to-end tests

`test_e2e.py` runs a real `df_engine` on the shipped
`configs/series-parquet-*.yaml`, sends OTLP/gRPC logs and metrics, and reads
the lake back with DuckDB:

- `LocalFiles`: `series-parquet-local.yaml` on a local directory; every
  acknowledged request is stored before shutdown.
- `Minio.test_strict_s3`: `series-parquet-s3.yaml` on a MinIO container;
  every acknowledged request is stored before shutdown.
- `Minio.test_strict_s3_shutdown_then_producer_retries`: the same
  configuration shut down with a 5 second deadline while the exporter holds
  every request in its open block; every request is answered OK or refused
  with a retryable status, and once the producer retries the refused ones
  against a new engine every request is stored at least once.
- `Minio.test_buffered_s3_shutdown_and_restart`: `series-parquet-buffered.yaml`
  (durable_buffer in front of the exporter) on MinIO, shut down gracefully
  while the exporter holds every request in its open block, which the shutdown
  refuses instead of writing; a restart on the same buffer directory writes
  them from the WAL with one new request, each exactly once.
- `Minio.test_buffered_s3_sigkill_replays` and
  `Minio.test_buffered_s3_sigkill_during_paused_write`: the same configuration
  SIGKILLed while the exporter holds every acknowledged request in its open
  block, or while it writes that block to a paused MinIO; after a restart on
  the same buffer directory every request is stored at least once.
- `AlloyConfigs`: `alloy validate` of the Alloy image checks
  `configs/series-parquet.alloy` and `configs/series-parquet-strict.alloy`
  at the stability level they document.

Each test shortens the window, to one second (30 seconds for the two shutdown
tests, so the requests are still in the open block at shutdown); every other
setting is the shipped one. The suite takes about a minute and a half.

## Running

From `rust/otap-dataflow`:

```bash
cargo build -p otel-arrow-dfe --bin df_engine \
  --features series-parquet,aws,durable-buffer
python3 -m venv /tmp/series-parquet-venv
/tmp/series-parquet-venv/bin/pip install --require-hashes \
  -r crates/validation/tests/series_parquet/requirements.lock.txt
docker pull minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-04-22T22-12-26Z
docker pull grafana/alloy:v1.19.2
SERIES_REQUIRE_DOCKER=1 /tmp/series-parquet-venv/bin/python3 -m unittest \
  crates.validation.tests.series_parquet.test_e2e -v
```

`DF_ENGINE` selects another engine binary (default `target/debug/df_engine`),
`SERIES_MINIO_IMAGE` another MinIO image and `SERIES_ALLOY_IMAGE` another
Alloy image. The tests never pull an image. Without Docker or an image the
MinIO and Alloy tests skip, unless `SERIES_REQUIRE_DOCKER=1` turns the skip
into a failure.
